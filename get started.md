  <h2>Build your website in 3 steps</h2>

  <p>
  There are a few different ways to build a website using Beautiful Jekyll, and this document will go through the simplest one: using a fork on GitHub. For most people (including myself!), this easy method is the recommended one.
  </p>

  <p>
  Even if you choose to use one of the <a href="https://beautifuljekyll.com/getstarted/#install-steps-hard">advanced installation methods</a>, I still suggest you read through the easy method first.

<div class="gs-section-02">
  <h2>The easy way (recommended!)</h2>

  <p>
  Getting started is <em>literally</em> as easy as 1â€“2â€“3 ðŸ˜„
  </p>

  <p>
  Scroll down to see the steps involved, but here is a 30-second video just as a reference as you work through the steps. If you don't already have a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub account</a>, you'll need to sign up.

<div class="gs-section-03">
  <h3>1. Fork this project</h3>
  <p>
  Click on the <strong>Fork</strong> button at the top right corner of this page. Forking means that you're copying this entire project and all its files into your account. Do not click on the <strong>Create fork</strong> button on the next page yet.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Rename the repository to <code>YOURUSERNAME.github.io</code></h3>
  <p>
  You'll see the word "repository" used a lot in GitHub â€“ it simply means "project". Under <strong>Repository name</strong> you should see the name <code>beautiful-jekyll</code>. This is where you need to rename your project to <code>YOURUSERNAME.github.io</code> (replace <code>YOURUSERNAME</code> with your GitHub username).
  </p>

  <h3>3. Customize your website settings</h3>
  <p>
  Edit the <code>_config.yml</code> file to change any settings you want. To edit the file, click on it, then click the pencil icon to edit. After changing the settings, click the green <strong>Commit changes</strong> button to save.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Congratulations! You have a website!</h3>
  <p>
  If you named your project correctly and made an edit to the config file, your site should be ready in a minute or two at <code>https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io</code>.
