  <h2>Build your website in 3 steps</h2>
  <p>There are a few different ways to build a website using Beautiful Jekyll, and this document will go through the simplest one: using a fork on GitHub. For most people (including myself!), this easy method is the recommended one.</p>
  <p>Even if you choose to use one of the <a href="https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#installation">advanced installation methods</a>, I still suggest you read through the easy method first.</p>
</div>

<div class="gs-section-02">
  <h2>The easy way (recommended!)</h2>
  <p>Getting started is <em>literally</em> as easy as 1‚Äì2‚Äì3 üòÅ</p>
  <p>Scroll down to see the steps involved, but here is a 30-second video just as a reference as you work through the steps. If you don't already have a <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a>, you'll need to sign up.</p>
</div>

<div class="gs-section-03">
  <h2>Congratulations! You have a website!</h2>
  <p>If you named your project correctly and made an edit to the config file, your website should be ready in a minute or two at <code>https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io</code>. Every time you make a change to any file, your website will get rebuilt and should be updated in about a minute or so. Your website will be initialized with several sample blog posts and a couple other pages.</p>
</div>

<div class="gs-section-03">
  <h2>The harder way (for advanced users)</h2>
  <p>The instructions above explain how to use Beautiful Jekyll in the easiest way: by forking on GitHub. There are more <a href="https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#installation">advanced installation methods</a> that include either using GitHub Pages with remote themes, or using Ruby gems. They provide you with more control, but are only intended for advanced users.</p>
  <p><em>Note: Beautiful Jekyll was primarily designed to be used as a GitHub theme, so you will not get any support if you use this theme via Ruby gems.</em></p>
